# OpenCL path tracing

This project is Linux port of a tutorial [Path tracer](https://github.com/straaljager/OpenCL-path-tracing-tutorial-3-Part-1) made by Sam Lapere in his blog:
https://raytracey.blogspot.com/2017/01/opencl-path-tracing-tutorial-3-opengl.html
It's modified with intersection and shading algorithms from [scratchapixel v3](https://www.scratchapixel.com/).Original tutorials were using original classes for vectors, they were all rewritten to use [GLM library](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/).


# Description [hr]


Aplikacija koristi OpenCL za algoritam praÄ‡enja puta, te OpenGL za spremanje rezultata u buffer i njegovog prikazivanja.
